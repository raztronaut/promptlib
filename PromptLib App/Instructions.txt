We are building a simple MacOS app in SwiftUI that allows users to save a list of prompts
- It looks like PromptLibMock.png
- By default, when you type, it should search through the list of prompts on the left
- Each prompt, when selected, on the right side, should show the contents of the prompt, and in a bottom section, have information about the prompt, including the date it was created, model you've tagged it for, and any other Tags you have added to it
- If you press CMD + K, it should open a menu bar with the following options:
    - New Prompt (should open a dialog to create a new prompt)
    - Share Prompt (should open a dialog to share the prompt)
    - Add to Favorites (should add the prompt to the Favorites section)
    - Delete Prompt (in red and should have a confirmation prompt)
    - Edit Prompt (should open a dialog to edit the selected prompt. in red)
- The Prompts are saved locally in a JSON file in the user's documents folder
- The app should be called PromptLib
- The app should have a settings window that allows you to change the location of the prompts JSON file
- The app should have a about window that shows information about the app
- The app should have a help window that shows information about the app
- The app should have a menu bar that allows you to open the settings, about, and help windows
Complete this app in its entirety, including all the windows and functionality.
